# My Implementation of the game EDA 24 Q2
This edition was about Harry Pppppotter! ðŸ§¹ðŸª„

## How it works:
#### Summarized!

Every round is decided which players are enemies and which are friends. 

Then the enemies create a distance map on the surroundings with a bfs.

Finally every mage searches for a path to a desired objective allways being far from enemies.

And de Ghost... Searches for books to learn how to cast faster spells!

## Tooling:
Mybe the best part is the python script that runs the tests to enshure that an improvement is an improvement.
